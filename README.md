Hi! Welcome to one of my projects. Thank you for having the interest in what I'm doing to develop myself.

This is the website I developed during the beginning of my HTML5 & CSS3 course at alura.com.br

The teacher used it as a small project to teach the basics of text and image manipulation using CSS3, as well as basic tags we can use when editing text elements with HTML.

Inside the first-try folder you'll find the project I developed when I did the course for the first time. Inside the 24h-review you'll find the project I did when I was reviewing it 24 hours later.

Although simple, hope you enjoy it.
