Hi! Welcome to one of my projects. Thank you for having the interest in what I'm doing to develop myself.

This is the website I developed during the beginning of my HTML5 & CSS3 course at alura.com.br

The teacher used it as a small project to teach the basics of text and image manipulation using CSS3, as well as basic tags we can use when editing text elements with HTML.

In order to create a long-term memory I study using the Hermann Ebbinghaus method, reviewing a subject 24h after seeing it for the first time, then 1 week later, then 1 month later. So that's why of the 24h/1w/1month-review pastes. It may look the same, but I'm trying to evolve the project I'm using to study in at least 1%, so if you want to check the progress it might be interesting to open all projects, otherwise I'd recommend you only opening the most recent updated one haha!

Although simple, hope you enjoy it.
